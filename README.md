Python Data Structures
======================
ADTS:
- Queue with head and tail ptr, insert new at head, remove old at tail
- Queue with only head ptr, remove old at head, append new to the end
- Stack (push/pop at head)

Linked List Operations:
- insert
- append
- returnIndex
- updateIndex
- deleteIndex
- insertBeforeIndex
- insertAfterIndex
- deleteData
- deleteAllData
- insertAfterEveryData
- insertBeforeEveryData
- deleteList
- copyList
- findMthToLastNode

Types:
- Single LL with head pointer
- Double LL with head pointer
- Circular LL with head & tail pointers

Unit Tests to test all 3 types and each operation

Binary Search Tree Operations:
- insert
- insertList
- find
- delete
- traverseBFS
- traverseDFSpreorder
- traverseDFSinorder
- traverseDFSpostorder
- copyTree
- findMin
- findMax

Types:
- Iterative (uses Queue(head ptr) and Stack for traversals)
- Recursive (not done)

Unit Tests to test each operation
