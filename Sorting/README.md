# *Sorting:*
## Selection Sorts:
### HeapSort - uses an array-based binary heap, in-place sort, not stable,
    O(n) best case, O(n log n) AVG/worst case performance, O(1) auxiliary space

## Merge Sorts:
### MergeSort - not in place, stable sort, O(n log n) best/AVG/worst case performance,
    O(n) auxiliary space

## Exchange Sorts:
### QuickSort - not in place, not stable, O(n log n) best/AVG, O(n^2) worst case
    performance, O(n) auxiliary space, fastest on average

Tested using language provided sort method to compare the result on a random.shuffle() list
